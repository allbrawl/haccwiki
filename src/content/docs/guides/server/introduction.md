Hello! This guide is going to show you the basics of making your own Brawl Stars server from scratch. It does not show how to get packet structure of full code, the aforementioned guide to getting packet structure I will release at a future date. This guide will show code examples in C++ from my [V44 server](https://github.com/allbrawl/nbs), but you can apply the same things to other programming languages.
